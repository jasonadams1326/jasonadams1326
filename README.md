### Hi there, I'm Jason Adams

Iâ€™m passionate about software because I love the combination of problem solving and creative expression. After serving in the Army, I was looking for something that would challenge me and allow me to continue to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. As a veteran, Iâ€™m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and mental health and Iâ€™m currently building mental health treatment applications in my spare time.  If youâ€™re looking for a passionate front end/full stack developer, or if you too are interested in using technology to improve quality of life, feel free to connect!

<div>Back End | Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL</div>
<div>Testing/Deployment | AWS EC2, Mocha, Chai, Jest, Artillery.io, Loader.io</div>
